[![Swift 4.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-4.2-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) [![Swift 5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plattforms-iOS%20-blue)

## Prerequisites

* Installed and configured development environment, namely [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
* Installed Cocoa Pods for your Mac. See [Cocoa Pods](https://cocoapods.org/) for more information.
* An account in our [Mercedes-Benz /developers portal](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/).
* A simulated vehicle. Login to our portal and open our [simulation environment](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/car-simulator) within the same browser so that the authenticated user gets created on the simulator. This must only be done once!

## Intended Usage
### Step 1. Subscription

* Open the [Mercedes-Benz /developers portal](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/sdks) and navigate to SDKS > IOS.
* Get your subscription for the SDK by clicking the "GET ACCESS" button on the top right of the overview page.
* For now, we suggest subscribing to the Standard Sandbox product.
* You will then find your OAuth credentials that you'll need in the next step in the CONSOLE area of our portal.

### Step 2. Get familiar with the sample app

* Clone the repository of our sample app via `git clone https://github.com/Daimler/MBSDK-Example-iOS.git`.
* Install the neccessary pods via `pod update`.
* Open the MBMobileExample.xcworkspace file.
* Open the `MBMobileSDKConfigurationHelper.swift` file within the `Helper` group and set your ClientID that you received with your OAuth credentials in the previous step as a parameter of the the configuration.
* Build and run the project.
* Login with the same email adress you are using for the portal and the simulation enviroment (see Step 1). You can enter any pin.

**Reminder:** The app is now communicating with a simulated vehicle. If you want to use the sample app with a real vehicle, a productive key is needed.

### Step 3. Start development

Check our next guide about [setting up the SDK](setting_up_sdk.md).
